This is the code for the Cloud Computing System Coursework 2.  
In this repository, two machine learning models were implemented on two serverless computing platforms.   
The commercial platform is Microsoft Azure, all codes executed on this platform are stored in the folder "Commercial platform-Azure". 
There are three subfolders under this folder.   
The first one is linear-regression-vscode, this folder contains the code for training a linear regression model for fitting a formula, and was developed using VSCode.   
The second folder is lr-inference-vscode, which contains the code of using the trained linear regression model for inferencing. This code was also developed using VSCode.  
The third one is resnet-vscode, this folder stores the code for training a resnet50 model for image classification, which is a subset of the Cifar10 dataset, with 1000 randomly sampled images. The code was also developed using VSCode.  
The open-source platform is OpenFaaS, whose codes are stored in the folder, "Opensource platform-OpenFaaS".  
Sub-folders in this folder follow a similar pattern in the "Commercial platform-Azure".
